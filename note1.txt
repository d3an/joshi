Interesting note in section 4.6: the `new` command provided by the C++ Standard Library is inherently inefficient for multiple use cases. It is sometimes necessary to overwrite the function for
increased program optimization. Although this is not an ideal solution, it merits an interesting point. Further research should be conducted.
